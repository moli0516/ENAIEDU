[1] When Helen Keller was almost two years old, she got sick with a high fever.
Because of that, she could not see or hear. Soon, she could not talk. Her parents
were so sad.
[2] When Helen was seven years old, a teacher called Anne Sullivan came to see
Helen’s parents. Helen’s mum told Anne, “Helen can’t see or hear for five years. She
is dumb too so she can’t tell us what she wants or how she feels. She has had many
teachers before but they couldn’t understand her and Helen was like a wild animal in
class. One by one they left.”
[3] The next morning, Anne had breakfast with Helen’s family. Helen was walking
around the table and eating everyone’s food with her hands. Anne said to Helen’s
parents, “I will teach Helen right now but I need a private place.”
[4] The servant took Anne and Helen to the nearby house and she left. At the next
meal at the house, Helen ate very noisily and messily again. So, Anne took away
Helen’s food. Finally, Helen sat down at the table. Anne returned Helen’s plate of
food. But Anne did not let her eat until Helen sat still and used a spoon.
[5] A few days later, Helen and Anne came to her parents’ home for dinner. Helen
could sit still at the table and eat with a spoon. They were so surprised.
“Unbelievable! I have never thought Helen would learn again!” Helen’s mum
cried.
